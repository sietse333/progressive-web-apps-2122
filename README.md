**Wishlist**

- I sadly didnt have enough time for the zoom in function. I have experimented with it and i got the hashes to work for each individual poster but making a page around it wasnt doable.
- I have a bug with my searchbar that when it has count = 0 it still shows some paintings. I didnt have enough time to get it fixed. I did however fixed a bug that was causing my searches to be inacurate.
- A big wish for me was that the searchbar sort of auto corrects what you are typing. This however was a bit above my skill level.
- Lastly i got my function that adds 10 paintings to the reel working. But it keeps adding the same 10. i dont have enough time to get that fixed before the deadline
